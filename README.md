# MLPerf HPC

This is a landing page for the MLPerf HPC working group and benchmark suite.
This material will eventually be moved into https://github.com/mlcommons.

## Overview

The HPC working group in [MLPerf](https://mlperf.org/) is working on ML
benchmarking on supercomputers. We are currently working on publishing a v0.5
HPC training benchmark suite. For an overview, please see
[these slides from the MLBench workshop at ISPASS 2020](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZXi9JHewwTj7-fLQLmd5oxYhRrdhxo95AfzKLeu20Jg/edit?usp=sharing).

Group chairs:
- Steven Farrell, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
- Jacob Balma, Hewlett Packard Enterprise
- Abid Malik, Brookhaven National Laboratory

Deputy chairs:
- Murali Emani, Argonne National Laboratory
- Aristeidis Tsaris, Oak Ridge National Laboratory

To join the group, first join the general MLPerf group and then the HPC working
group as described here: https://mlperf.org/get-involved/

## Benchmarks

Reference implementations are at [benchmarks](benchmarks).

### Rules

The MLPerf HPC v0.5 rules are based on the MLPerf Training v0.7 rules with
some adjustments.

The MLPerf Training rules are available at [training\_rules](https://github.com/sparticlesteve/training_policies/blob/hpc-updates/training_rules.adoc).

The MLPerf HPC specific rules are at [hpc\_training\_rules](https://github.com/sparticlesteve/training_policies/blob/hpc-updates/hpc_training_rules.adoc).
